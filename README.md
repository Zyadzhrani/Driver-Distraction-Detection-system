# 🚗 Driver Distraction Detection System

This project presents a real-time embedded system designed to detect driver distractions using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. Leveraging the NVIDIA Jetson Nano 4GB, the system continuously monitors the driver's behavior through an RGB-IR camera and identifies key distraction types such as mobile phone usage, talking to passengers, and improper hand placement on the steering wheel. The solution combines efficient object detection with GPIO-based feedback mechanisms, making it suitable for real-world deployment in vehicles.

## 📘 Project Overview
Driver distraction is a major cause of road accidents. Our system detects four critical types of distractions:

### 1. Using a Mobile Phone
![Using mobile phone](Using_mobile_phone.jpg)

### 2. Talking on the Phone (Left or Right Hand)

### 3. Talking to Passengers

## 📸 Classes Detected
| Class ID | Class Name                     |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| 0        | Talking to Passenger           |
| 1        | Hands                          |
| 3        | Using Mobile Phone             |
| 4        | Steering Wheel                 |
| 6        | Talking on Phone (Left/Right)  |
| 7        | Normal Face                    |


## 🧪 Validation
- Achieved over **91% mAP@0.5**
- Successfully deployed on Jetson Nano for real-time performance
- Robust under both day and night conditions using RGB + IR camera




## ⚙️ Future Work
- Expand distraction classes (e.g., eating, drowsiness)
- Add dashboard for remote fleet management
- Integrate haptic or visual alerts
- Optimize for Jetson Orin Nano
